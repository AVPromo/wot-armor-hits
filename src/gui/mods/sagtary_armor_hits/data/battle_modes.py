"""Battle modes: the client's battle types (Battle.battleType, constants.ARENA_GUI_TYPE) in groups by how much the
battle asks of the player's skill, and how the battles of each group are kept (the battleModes setting).

The groups, in the settings menu's order:
- random: battles by the usual rules (random, grand battles, Mapbox);
- competitive: rated and team battles (ranked, Onslaught, team battles, Stronghold);
- training: not real battles (training rooms, the modes' trainings, map training);
- fun: farm and event modes, where skill matters little (Frontline, Steel Hunter, special modes, events, ...);
- other: every type of no group: the special battle, and the modes a client update adds.

A group's battles are kept:
- OFF: not at all, the hits screen does not get them;
- SESSION: until the game closes;
- FILE: until the game closes, and in their battle files from the moment the player leaves them.
By default the random and the competitive battles are kept for the session, the others not.

The types are looked up by their names when needed: the game modes (comp7, fun_random, ...) add theirs to
ARENA_GUI_TYPE while the client starts, after the mod is imported.
